# ðŸ“œ Checking the In-game list

## Requirements

1. **Minecraft** (Java Edition) with the _More SCP Alarm_ mod installed.
2. Access to the game console or command terminal.

#### Steps

**1. Open Minecraft and Start Your World (or a Server with the Mod Installed)**

Make sure the _More SCP Alarm_ mod is loaded in your instance of Minecraft. You can verify this in the **Mods** list on the main menu.

**2. Use the `/playsound` Command to Find Available Sounds**

In Minecraft, the `/playsound` command allows you to access sounds by their identifier. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

* Open the command console by pressing `T` (or `/` directly).
*   Type the following command to play a sound from the _More SCP Alarm_ mod:

    ```plaintext
    /playsound more_scp_alarm:sound_name @p
    ```

    Replace `sound_name` with the specific sound name you want to try.

**Tip**: You can try auto-completing the sound names by typing the first few letters after `more_scp_alarm:` and pressing `Tab`. This is very usefull to find the list!

**3. Check the `sounds.json` File for a Full List of Sounds (Optional)**

If youâ€™d like a complete list of all sounds included in the mod, you can find it in the modâ€™s files:

1. Go to [The GitHub page of More SCP Alarm](../src/main/resources/assets/more\_scp\_alarm/sounds.json).
2. Download the `sound.json` and open it

The `sounds.json` file contains all the available sound identifiers in the mod, listed as paths like:

```json
...
  "bang": {
    "category": "player",
    "sounds": [
      {
        "name": "more_scp_alarm:bang1",
        "stream": false
      },
      {
        "name": "more_scp_alarm:bang2",
        "stream": false
      },
      {
        "name": "more_scp_alarm:bang3",
        "stream": false
      }
    ]
  },
...
```

The first line `"bang"` is the sound identifier and can be used in the `/playsound` command.

**4. Testing a Sound**

To test a sound, return to Minecraft and use the `/playsound` command with one of the identifiers from the list. For example:

```plaintext
/playsound more_scp_alarm:alarm-1 @p
```

This will play the `alarm-1` sound near your character.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a sound doesnâ€™t work, double-check the identifier and make sure the mod is loaded.
{% endhint %}
